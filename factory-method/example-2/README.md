**Problem: Virtual Vending Machine**

**Requirements:**

1. Create a virtual vending machine system that dispenses different types of products.
2. The vending machine should support various product categories such as snacks, beverages, and hygiene products.
3. Each product category may have specific variations and features.
4. The system should allow the addition of new product categories and variations without modifying the core vending machine logic.
5. Products in the vending machine should have common functionalities like "dispense" and "getPrice."

**Test Cases:**

1. **Adding Snack Category:**

   - Add a snack category to the vending machine.
   - Add two variations of snacks, e.g., chocolate and chips.
   - Verify that the vending machine recognizes and dispenses snacks correctly.
2. **Adding Beverage Category:**

   - Add a beverage category to the vending machine.
   - Add two variations of beverages, e.g., soda and water.
   - Verify that the vending machine recognizes and dispenses beverages correctly.
3. **Adding Hygiene Product Category:**

   - Add a hygiene product category to the vending machine.
   - Add two variations of hygiene products, e.g., toothpaste and hand sanitizer.
   - Verify that the vending machine recognizes and dispenses hygiene products correctly.
4. **Adding New Snack Variation:**

   - Add a new variation of snack, e.g., popcorn, to the existing snack category.
   - Verify that the vending machine can dispense the new snack variation without affecting other categories.
5. **Adding New Category and Variation:**

   - Add a new category, e.g., electronic gadgets, to the vending machine.
   - Add two variations of electronic gadgets, e.g., headphones and USB chargers.
   - Verify that the vending machine can handle the new category and variations seamlessly.
6. **Common Functionality Test:**

   - Create instances of different products from various categories.
   - Execute the "dispense" functionality for each product and verify the correct message is displayed.
   - Execute the "getPrice" functionality for each product and verify that the correct price is returned.

This problem involves creating a flexible virtual vending machine system where the Factory Method pattern can be applied to handle the creation of different product categories and variations. The goal is to allow easy extensibility for adding new categories and products in the future.
